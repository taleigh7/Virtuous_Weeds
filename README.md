Virtuous Weeds
A tale of perspectives

This repository is for a practice webpage "Virtuous_Weeds".
Virtuous Weeds is a website of tales related to those things and souls, including 
the plants we call weeds, whose virtues may be overlooked by society in general.

(Adding this line and the image below to create a conflict with the repo's README file on my computer)
